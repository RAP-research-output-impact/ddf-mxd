The directory test/cat contains records in the format in which they are
stored in the database (plus some indentation). Main difference with 
the exported (Zebra) is, that the local fields have tags like local,
local2, local3 etc. to cater for Metatoo's (im)possibilities with forms.

Look at test/*.xml to see the format that end-users get to see when
they download records.
