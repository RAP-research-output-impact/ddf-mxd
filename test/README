The test/ directory contains sample records of all Orbit literature types in
the format in which Zebra indexes them, which is also the format end-users
get to see if the 'download' records. The orb2mxd script expects this type
of XML.

One important difference with the cataloguing format is, that the download
format has local fields in the form local/field/@num=1, local/field/@num=2 
etc., rather than local/field, local2/field etc.

The test/cat/ subdir has records in cataloguing format, for fun and 
comparison.
