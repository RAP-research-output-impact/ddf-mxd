Change:

The namespace remains http://mx.forskningsdatabasen.dk/ns/mxd/1.1
whereas the format_version becomes 1.1.1.

Preface:

The version number definition has been changed, such that adding
backward-compatible changes (like new non-mandatory elements) does not
require a new namespace definition in the document. The current
schema, 1.1.1, will therefore also validate 1.1.0 documents.


Formulation:

1. represents a major version - an increment would require a thorough
   study of the new version and subsequent changes of style sheets and
   other programs.

   Changes in major version always imply both a new release of the
   schema, AND a change in the namespace declaration. The new version
   of the schema will therefore NOT validate older documents.

2. represents a revision, which modifies some definitions of the
   previous version in a way that is not backward compatible with
   older version. An increment of the revision number would most
   likely require the update of XSLT style sheets for presentation or
   similar purposes.

   Changes in revision always imply both a new release of the schema,
   AND a change in the namespace declaration. The new version of the
   schema will therefore NOT validate older documents.

3. represents a minor revision, which either only contains changes in
   wording or clarifications, OR expands the vocabulary of certain
   elements, OR which adds new non-mandatory data elements in a way
   which still validates older documents with the same version and
   revision.

   An increment in minor revision number may require updates of XSLT
   style sheets and similar in order to reflect newly-added
   elements.
